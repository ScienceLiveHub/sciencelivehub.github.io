## Transforming Scientific Communication

**Science Live** is pioneering the future of scientific knowledge sharing through structured, machine-readable research data that breaks down institutional and disciplinary barriers.

### Our Mission

We believe that scientific breakthroughs happen faster when researchers can easily discover, understand, and build upon each other's work across all domains of knowledge.

### The Challenge We're Solving

Today's research landscape faces critical obstacles that slow scientific progress:

- **Knowledge Silos** - Valuable research insights remain trapped within institutions and disciplines
- **Inaccessible Formats** - Scientific findings locked in narrative formats that resist computational analysis
- **Discovery Barriers** - Researchers struggle to find relevant work across different fields
- **Limited Traceability** - Difficulty connecting claims to original data and methodologies

### Our Solution

Science Live has developed a comprehensive platform that transforms how scientific knowledge is created, shared, and discovered through:

**Structured Knowledge Representation**
Converting research outputs into nanopublications - the smallest possible units of scientific information that can be independently verified and connected.

**Decentralized Infrastructure** 
Building on a distributed network that ensures no single point of control while maintaining open access to scientific knowledge.

**Intelligent Discovery**
Advanced AI processing that enables researchers to explore knowledge networks using natural language while receiving precise, contextual results.

**Community-Driven Growth**
Creating a sustainable ecosystem where the platform becomes more valuable as more researchers contribute their knowledge.

### Our Products

**Science Live Pipeline**
Our flagship open-source toolkit that enables researchers to query scientific knowledge using natural language. The pipeline transforms questions into structured semantic queries and returns comprehensive, traceable results.

**Nanopublication Framework**
A robust system for creating, validating, and sharing structured scientific statements with complete provenance tracking.

**Knowledge Graph Platform**
A growing network of interconnected scientific knowledge that spans disciplines and enables unprecedented discovery capabilities.

### Core Values

**Open Science**
We are committed to transparent, accessible research that benefits the entire scientific community. All our tools are open source and our knowledge graphs are freely accessible.

**Scientific Rigor**
Every component of our platform maintains the highest standards of scientific accuracy, with full traceability and provenance for all knowledge claims.

**Community First**
We design our products with and for researchers, ensuring that our tools enhance rather than complicate existing research workflows.

**Global Impact**
We aim to accelerate scientific discovery worldwide by connecting knowledge across languages, institutions, and disciplines.

### Technology Leadership

Science Live is built on proven semantic web technologies and established standards:

- **FAIR Principles** for findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable data
- **W3C Semantic Web Standards** including RDF, SPARQL, and OWL
- **Nanopublication Framework** for structured scientific statements
- **Advanced AI Processing** for natural language understanding and generation

### Real-World Impact

Our platform serves researchers across multiple domains:

**Individual Researchers** can discover relevant literature across disciplines, understand research impact through citation analysis, and connect their findings to the broader knowledge ecosystem.

**Research Institutions** gain comprehensive views of their research landscape, identify collaboration opportunities, and demonstrate the real-world impact of their investments.

**Scientific Publishers** can enhance their content with structured metadata and provide readers with enriched discovery experiences.

**Funding Organizations** can track research outcomes more effectively and identify emerging areas of scientific opportunity.

### Example Capabilities

Science Live enables researchers to ask complex questions and receive comprehensive answers:

- "What papers cite the original transformer paper in machine learning?"
- "Who are the leading researchers in CRISPR gene editing applications?"
- "What experimental measurements exist for graphene electrical conductivity?"
- "How do current climate models incorporate biodiversity considerations?"

### Partnership with Astera Institute

Science Live is proud to partner with the Astera Institute, launching our collaborative initiative in April 2025. This partnership represents a shared commitment to advancing scientific communication through innovative technology and community-driven development.

### Leadership Team

**Anne Fouilloux, Founder & CEO**
With over 25 years of experience spanning academic research and software engineering, Anne brings deep expertise in semantic technologies, FAIR data principles, and open science practices. Her proven track record in distributed project management and community building positions Science Live for sustainable growth and impact.
