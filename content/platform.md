# Science Live Platform

## Transforming Research into Connected Knowledge

Science Live addresses one of the most pressing challenges in modern research: **knowledge silos** that prevent effective collaboration and discovery across disciplines, institutions, and research domains.

### The Architecture

Our platform transforms narrative scientific results into structured, machine-actionable data using:

- **Nanopublications Framework** → Smallest units of scientific information that can stand alone
- **Decentralized Server Network** → Distributed infrastructure with no single point of failure  
- **Semantic Integration** → Standards-based approach ensuring interoperability
- **AI Processing Pipeline** → 7-step transformation from questions to answers

### Key Capabilities

#### For Researchers
- **Rapid Literature Discovery** → Find relevant papers across disciplines instantly
- **Citation Analysis** → Understand influence networks and research impact
- **Concept Exploration** → Discover how ideas connect across fields
- **Data Integration** → Link findings to underlying datasets and methods

#### For Institutions
- **Research Analytics** → Understand institutional research landscape
- **Collaboration Discovery** → Find potential partners based on complementary work
- **Impact Assessment** → Track real-world influence of research outputs
- **Knowledge Management** → Organize and preserve institutional knowledge

#### For the Scientific Community
- **Open Knowledge Network** → Collectively built, globally accessible research graph
- **Reduced Duplication** → Discover existing work before starting new projects
- **Accelerated Innovation** → Build on structured knowledge from any domain
- **Transparent Provenance** → Full traceability from claims to original sources

### Technology Stack

- **Python Pipeline** → `science-live-pipeline` package for programmatic access
- **SPARQL Queries** → Industry-standard semantic web query language
- **RDF/OWL** → Formal knowledge representation standards
- **REST APIs** → Integration with existing research tools and workflows
