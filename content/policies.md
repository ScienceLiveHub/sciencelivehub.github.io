This policy outlines how Science Live handles research data, API usage, and intellectual property. We are committed to open science principles while ensuring platform sustainability and data integrity.

## Data Ownership and Rights

### Your Content
- You retain copyright of all nanopublications and research data you create
- By publishing, you agree to release nanopublications under CC-BY 4.0 license
- **Published nanopublications are permanent and cannot be deleted**
- Science Live maintains the right to host and distribute your nanopublications permanently

### Data Portability
- Export your complete data at any time via our API or data export tools
- Standard formats: RDF, JSON-LD, CSV
- No vendor lock-in: your data remains yours

## Data Access and Openness

### Public Access
- All nanopublications are publicly accessible by default
- Once published, nanopublications are permanent and cannot be deleted
- No registration required to read nanopublications
- Machine-readable formats available for all content
- Persistent identifiers ensure permanent citability

### Access Restrictions
- No paywalls for accessing research data
- Commercial use permitted under platform terms
- Bulk downloading subject to rate limits

## API Usage Terms

### Rate Limits and Quotas

API rate limits and nanopublication quotas vary by account type. Higher tiers receive increased limits and additional features.

- **Rate limiting**: Requests per hour vary by account tier
- **Nanopublication quotas**: Monthly limits based on account type
- **API features**: Advanced endpoints available for higher tiers
- **Current limits**: Check your account dashboard for specific quotas

*Limits are subject to change. We notify users of significant modifications.*

### API Best Practices
- Use compression for large requests
- Implement exponential backoff for retries
- Cache responses appropriately
- Include descriptive User-Agent headers
- Use pagination for large result sets

### Prohibited API Uses
- Attempting to circumvent rate limits
- Creating duplicate accounts to increase quotas
- Scraping for competitive services
- Distributing API keys publicly
- Using the API for spam or abuse

## Data Privacy and Security

### Privacy Standards
- GDPR compliant data handling
- No personal information in nanopublications
- Data processing agreements available

### Data Security
- Daily automated backups
- Geographically distributed storage
- 99.9% uptime SLA (Institutional/Industry accounts)
- Incident response within 24 hours

## Content Licensing

### Nanopublication License
Nanopublications are published under **CC-BY 4.0 International**

## Data Retention and Deletion

### Active Accounts
- Data retained indefinitely
- Full version history maintained
- Automated backups for disaster recovery

### Inactive Accounts
- Accounts inactive for 24 months receive warning
- 30-day grace period to reactivate
- After deletion, nanopublication IDs remain but content is removed

### Nanopublication Permanence
- **Nanopublications cannot be deleted once published**
- Published content remains permanently accessible
- Corrections must be made through new versions or retractions
- Only account information and unpublished drafts can be deleted
- This ensures scientific record integrity and citation stability

## Acceptable Use

### Basic Principles
- Publish accurate research data
- Provide proper attribution
- Respect intellectual property rights
