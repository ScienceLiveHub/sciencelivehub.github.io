Science Live is a revolutionary platform that transforms how scientific knowledge is shared, discovered, and built upon. By converting narrative research findings into structured, machine-readable data, we're breaking down the silos that limit scientific progress.

## Our Mission

To accelerate scientific discovery by making research findings more accessible, interpretable, and reusable through semantic knowledge graphs and decentralized publishing.

## Key Features

- **Nanopublications**: Structured scientific claims with full provenance
- **Semantic Integration**: Machine-readable knowledge graphs
- **Cross-disciplinary Discovery**: Find unexpected connections
- **Open Access**: Decentralized, democratized knowledge sharing

## The Technology

Built on proven standards including nanopublications, FAIR principles, and semantic web technologies, Science Live creates a global network of interconnected scientific knowledge.
