# Research Applications

## Real-World Impact Across Scientific Domains

Science Live is designed to work across all research areas, breaking down traditional disciplinary boundaries to accelerate discovery.

### Current Focus Areas

#### Biodiversity Research
- **Species Discovery** → Connect taxonomic classifications with ecological data
- **Conservation Planning** → Link habitat requirements with climate projections
- **Ecosystem Modeling** → Integrate biological and environmental measurements

#### Biological Imaging
- **Method Comparison** → Compare imaging techniques across different biological systems
- **Data Standards** → Connect image metadata with analysis protocols
- **Reproducibility** → Link image processing steps to original experimental conditions

#### Earth Observation
- **Climate Data Integration** → Connect satellite observations with ground-based measurements
- **Model Validation** → Link climate projections with observational data
- **Cross-Scale Analysis** → Connect local measurements with global patterns

### Example Use Cases

#### Cross-Domain Discovery
**Question:** "How do climate models connect to biodiversity research?"
**Science Live Result:** Discovers papers linking climate projections to species distribution models, connecting earth system scientists with conservation biologists.

#### Method Discovery
**Question:** "What imaging techniques are used to study plant cell walls?"
**Science Live Result:** Identifies multiple imaging approaches across different journals and research groups, revealing complementary methods.

#### Expert Networks
**Question:** "Who are the key researchers working on ocean acidification impacts?"
**Science Live Result:** Maps collaboration networks and identifies potential new partnerships based on complementary expertise.

### Community Contributions

Science Live grows stronger as more researchers contribute knowledge:

- **Nanopub Creation** → Transform your research into structured statements
- **Domain Templates** → Create field-specific templates for common claim types
- **Validation Networks** → Peer review and endorse structured scientific statements
- **Tool Integration** → Connect Science Live with discipline-specific software

### Future Directions

We're actively expanding into new domains:

- **Clinical Research** → Medical evidence synthesis and treatment planning
- **Materials Science** → Property-structure relationships across material types
- **Social Sciences** → Methodology comparison and evidence integration
- **Computational Sciences** → Algorithm performance and implementation studies
